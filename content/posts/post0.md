summary: A teeny-tiny guide on PBS (Pro Job Scheduler)


Pro Job Scheduler (PBS) is a computer software that performs job scheduling, and workload management in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments - clusters, supercomputers, etc.

Now during my post-graduate studies, I got to explore the world of distributed algorithms. I have created a repository of various algorithms implemented wih OpenMPI (MPICH 3.0) here.

To execute the algorithms, I used the cluster computing in my grad school. The cluster accepted jobs through PBS and that's where I got to learn about how PBS works, and how to run MPI programs with it on a cluster.
